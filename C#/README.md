*This program currently only works on https://webtoons.com!*




1. Click on the "Save Directory" button to pick the folder in which the cartoons are going to be stored
    * Each cartoon will have its own folder, and each episode will have its own folder inside the cartoon's folder.

2. Enter the desired folder's title for the cartoon in the "Enter title" textfield.

3. Go to the main page of the cartoon to be downloaded and copy the URL
    * The URL has this pattern: "https://www.webtoons.com/en/cartoongenre/cartoonname/list?title_no=sequenceofnumbers"

4. Paste the URL in the "Enter url" textfield, below the "Enter title" textfield.

5. Click on the "Add" button to add the cartoon to the download queue.

6. Click the "Start" button to start downloading.

* Don't bother reading the below explanation of the "Make HTML Page" checkbox if you don't plan on reading the webtoons in a browser as in the official webtoons page, are not using a Windows computer, or have no internet connection.

* The "Make HTML Page" checkbox enables/disables the option for the script to generate a webpage using the images just like in the official cartoon's page. Should only be enabled if you plan on using a Windows desktop (I haven't implemented options for other OSes) to read the webtoons in a web browser, just like the original experience. You should also have internet connection for this. If checked, there are going to be 3 files generated by the script in each episode's folder it was enabled for:
    * num_images.txt - How many images the episode has, you should not delete/rename/edit this file. (It's needed for the page to load the images correctly)
    * start_webserver.bat - A simple command to start a local web server ("python -m http.server"), which is needed for the page to correctly load the images.
    * index.html - The webpage generated. (You shouldn't open it directly, open the .bat file and go to the local server page outputted by it)

# FIRST PROJECT USING A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE AND C#

Since I didn't have any C# projects in my Github page, as well as nearly no practice with the language, I figured I would refactor my Python script for downloading webtoons into C#, so that I could practice the language.

Also implement a Graphical User Interface, as all my Python scripts are console-based, and the only code I have written that has a GUI was in C++, although they don't really have any functionality and integration with user interactions (at least in this moment).

I still have a lot to implement in the program, fixes to make, handle exceptions, and the usual... However, since I have no C# projects in my Github, and as the program works perfectly fine and as intended (for its purpose), I decided to upload it to this page.

Things to note:

* My first "proper" GUI and C# program, same goes for WPF (I had to learn a lot of things on-the-fly, lol);

* First time using HTTP requests and a HTML parser with C#;

* First time manipulating files with C#.

# CURRENT PLANS

* Instead of always asking users to type the title of the folder to be created for the specific cartoon, add an optional checkbox which would enable a regular expression check in the cartoon's url in order to find the cartoon's title and use it to name the folder.

* If the cartoon hasn't been completely downloaded, leave it in the queue even if the user restarts the program and only remove it from the queue if the user manually deletes it by using the "delete selected" or "clear queue".

* Show progress bar of how much is left for the current episode's download to end, as well for the current cartoon, and perhaps the whole queue.

* Show how many episodes have already been completely downloaded for each cartoon in the queue and remove cartoons that have been downloaded from the queue.

* Add pause/resume options for downloading/paused operations.

* Add proper hover animations for the buttons.

* Handle for wrong url inputs.

* Handle for stopping the download middle operation.

* Add proper verbose information in the text box.

* Add option for downloading a specific amount of episodes, or range of episodes from a specific cartoon.

* Possibly add a separate tab/reserved space for displaying information about the cartoon, such as
rating, synopsis, artwork, genre, artist(s), available episodes, release date, available languages (as well as option for changing languages). (Also store these kinds of informations in a database before downloading the cartoon in a local database, so that even if you have no internet connection it loads)

* In case of doing the above, also add a table that checks the current directory for downloaded cartoons, and get information from the local database by using the folder title.

* Add an option checking for new episodes on already downloaded cartoons.

* Add tab that displays the most popular titles and information about them, as in their official main page.

* Add option for searching the website (maybe in the future use the search bar to get the exact url and title of the desired cartoon to be downloaded?).

* Maybe add download options for other websites?
